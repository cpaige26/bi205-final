<h5 style="font-size: larger;">The Bible is a Story That Has a Central Character and Theme:</h5>
        <p style="text-indent: 30px; ">The central theme of the Bible is God's unflaking love for his creation. Time and time again, we (his people) have failed him and yet
        he has always given us grace, even when we are not deserving of it. We can see how much grace God has given us by him sending his son, Jesus Christ to Earth in order to redeem mankind from the sins that we have committed.
        The central character in the Bible is Jesus, being prophesied from the fall and all through the Old Testament up to his birth in the New Testament. 
        Some passages we can read to show us how to understand the Bible and the order of the Bible are; Mathew 5, Luke 24, and John 5.</p>


<h5 style="font-size: larger;">The Bible is divided into two testaments: Old Testament and New Testament</h5> 
<p style="text-indent: 10px;">How do they both relate to the theme of the Bible? How are they similar? How are they different?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Both are centered around Jesus Christ and his role in salvation</li>
    <li>Both show God's greatness</li>
    <li>The Old Testament is before Jesus and tells mankind of the coming savior</li>
    <li>The New Testament is about Jesus's time on Earth and after entered heaven</li>
</ul>



<h5 style="font-size: larger;">The backbone of the Bible Storyline is comprised of 5 major Biblical covenants. These are the Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and the New Covenant.</h5> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">The first covenant, the Noahic took place in Genesis after the fall and the flood. In this covenant, God estabished with Noah a promise to never flood the world
again, signaled by the rainbow. God also promises that humanity will not be destroyed. The next covenant is the Abrahamic Covenant, here, God promises Abraham land, descendants, and blessing.
Key concepts and practices such as the Promised Land, election, the people of God, inheritance, circumcision, conflicts with surrounding nations and divisions between Jews and Gentiles are explained through the Abrahamic Covenant.
The third covenant is the Mosaic covenant. This covenant was established after the Israelites escaped slavery in Egypt and were atop Mount Sinai. In it, God promises the law that 
would govern and shape the Israelites in the Promised Land. This covenant was conditional and in Exodus 19 and 20, as well as Deuteronomy 28. God defined the blessings that the people 
would recieve if they followed him and also the curses if they disobeyed. The next covenant is the Davidic covenant. This covenant is a continuous promise of all the previous covenants
but also adds that a descendant from David will rule over the people of God. This covenant gives the people hope of Jesus the rightful King of the Jews. The final covenant is the New Covenant,
in the New Covenant God makes a promise with the house of Israel and of Judah. In it he promises forgiveness of sin, internal renewal of the heart, and intimate knowledge of God. These
covenants are a vital part to understanding how the Bible is meant to be understood as we are reading it. The Old Testament covenants estabish promises that look foward to fulfillment.
A lot of the New Testament shows how Jesus Christ fulfills these covenant promises and what life should look like for a people living in the New Covenant inaugurated by his death and resurrection.</p>    

<h5 style="font-size: larger;">The Bible is made up of 66 books, these books are broken up into 8 different sections, these include the Pentateuch, Historical Books, Wisdom Literature, Prophetic Books, Gospels, 
Acts, Epistles, and Revelation.</h5> 
<p>The Pentateuch is the first 5 books of the Bible, Genesis - Deuteronomy. These books show creation and the fall in Genesis, and how the Israelites prospered when following God's will
    and suffered when following their own will. The Historical Books contain Joshua through Esther. These books tell us how the Israelites entered the Promised Land after the Exodus.
    Also discussed is how the Israelites switched from a tribal rule to a monarchy and how the kingdom eventually fell to foreign enemies due to the Israelite's sin nature.
    The Wisdom Literature contains Job through Song of Solomon. In this section, God teaches people how to live and behave like Christians and to fear the Lord. The Prophetic Books are the last books of the Old Testament,
    they contain Isaiah through Malachi. These books focus on a call of repentence from the Israelites. The Gospels are the first 4 books of the New Testament. They are all different point of view's of the birth and life of Jesus Christ.
    These books focus on the teachings and ministry of Jesus as he walked the world. Acts is one book, the main message in Acts is, the Gospel is to be spread throughout the world for everyone to hear and receive.
    The Epistles contain Romans through Jude. Here the main message is Paul sending letters to churches around the world talking about the New Covenant.
    Revelation is one book. Here the main message is that Jesus will return and he will recreate the world and restore his people. Here I went through each book and attempted to pick out key chapters, main characters, main events, and key themes from each book.</p>
