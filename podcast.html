    <p style="text-indent: 25px; font-size: larger; color: #040234;">In this podcast, my discipleship and I attempted to answer important questions on how a biblical Worldview is important for everyday Christians. Some of the specific questions we tried to answer include;</p>
    <ul style="color: #040234; font-size: larger;">
        <li>Why is the order of the Bible important to the Bible Story?</li>
        <li>How does the storyline of the Bible teach us about Jesus and his role in redemption?</li>
        <li>How does "free will"come into play when thinking about Creation, Fall, and Redemption?</li>
        <li>What are some ways you can look at both the Old and New Testaments as one cohesive book?</li>
        <li>How should we read the Bible with a Biblical Worldview in mind?</li>
        <li>Why is it important to look at worldy matters with a Biblical Worldview?</li>
        <li>Can you remember a situation in your life where it was good that you approached it with a Biblical Worldview? Is there a time in your life where it would have been better to approach a situation with a Biblical Worldview?</li>
