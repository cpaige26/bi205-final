    <div class="secondtext">
            <p style="text-indent: 25px; color: #040234; font-size: larger; line-height: 1.5;">The Bible tells one unified story throughout. 
            That story is important, because it provides a Biblical worldview. It is extremely
            important for Christians to have a Biblical Worldview becuase it allows them to approach life the way God intended us to. To 
            understand what a Biblical Worldview is we have to talk about Creation, Fall, and Redemption. God created mankind with their own free 
            will so that we could choose to honor him without being forced to honor him. For some time all things were good until, Adam and Eve sinned.
            Because of the fall into sin and death, mankind gained a worldview full of sin. When Jesus came and died for our sins he allowed Christians
            to be saved by the grace of God giving us sinners redemption even though we are completely undeserving of it. Because Jesus died for our sins
            he gave Christians the ability to see the world and approach matters through a Biblical Worldview.</p>
