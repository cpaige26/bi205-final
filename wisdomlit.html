Here in the Wisdom Literature God is giving us lessons from Job to Song of Solomon about how to live for him. In Job, Job was tested and lost everything, yet he still believed in God and was rewarded. Psalms and Proverbs are lessons on how to think about certain world problems and how to figure these problems out. Ecclesiastes was all about how us Christians need God to feel content and happy. Without God we are nothing. Finally in Song of Solomon, this book teaches us how to treat our spouse. Together the Wisdom Literature books make sure everything pertaining to thinking and acting is covered.</td>
