    <p style="font-size: larger; text-indent: 30px; color: #040234; line-height: 1.5;">The Bible storyline has impacted me in the followed ways. Before taking this class, BI205 Creation to New Creation. I had this naive idea that the Bible was just a series of stories that were all jumbled together with no rhyme or reason. After this class I have learned that I was so incredibly wrong. Each book of the Bible follows a specific
    plot and together make the most beautiful, intricate book mankind has ever been blessed to read. I have layed it out in a way that makes sense to me in the Bible Storyline tab and I hope it is as clear to you as it is to me.</p>
